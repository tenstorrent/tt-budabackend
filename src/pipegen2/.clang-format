# Arguments, parameters and construction initializer are broken as following:
# - Try to fit everything into single line (controlled by ColumnLimit).
# - If it doesn't fit, break immediately after open bracket (in case of arguments and parameters)

# - Try to fit everything else into the second line.
# - If it doesn't fit in second line, then each argument, parameter or initializer will sit in its own line.
