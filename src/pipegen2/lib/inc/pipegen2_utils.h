    !!! ATTENTION !!!

    This file is meant to be only a temporary place for functions/defines used in multiple other files,
    which do not belong in any other file and do not warrant yet creating own file for them.

    As soon as you see the appropriate place to transfer some functions out of this file, or if you see that
    there are multiple related functions here that could be extracted into separate file, please do so.

    In ideal situation this file should be empty!

    In worst case scenario this file gets bloated and is included in many other files thus slowing the
    compilation time tremendously. Let's try to avoid that scenario!
