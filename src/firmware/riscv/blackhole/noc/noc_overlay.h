  Basic stream semantics:
  =======================


    1. A stream is associated with storage and a flow-control mechanism in
       both directions (i.e. possibility of backpressure on both sender
       and receiver).  A stream ID is unique per processor, and can be
       arbitrarily assigned in the course of initializing an overlay. 


    2. A stream data source can be: 

         (a) Output of the local processor (i.e. math/packer).

         (b) Data sent by a stream on a remote processor. 

         (c) Data sent by another local stream. 

       A stream can have at most one source of type (a) or (b), or multiple
       [limited by hardware resources - TBD] sources of type (c).

       For streams that gather data from N sources, it is necessary to set up
       N point-to-point streams, and then set up another stream  with N sources
       of type (c). 


     3. A stream destination can be:

         (a) Input to the local processor (i.e., unpacker/math).

         (b) A stream on a single remote processor.
 
         (c) Streams (each with the same local ID) in a group of 
             remote processors that is addressable as a multicast
             destination.  (This may include the local processor
             as well.)  All destinations must have the receiving 
             buffer at the same local memory address, and the same
             buffer size for wraparound.

         (d) Another local stream. (As discussed under 2(c) above.)

        A stream can have up to one destination of type (a), up to 
        one destination of type (b) or (c), and up to one destination
        of type (d).  Flow control is determined by the behavior of 
        the slowest-receiving destination. 


     4. After the initialization phase, software needs to deal with only those
        streams that directly consume the output of the local processor (i.e.,
        math/packer) or directly supply the input of the local processor (i.e.,
        math/unpacker).  Everything else runs automatically, providing a simple
        abstraction. 


  Example:
  ========

  Suppose we have the following setup for a layer, with 32 cores involved
  (x-dimension size = 4, y-dimension size = 8):
    
     1. Two clusters, with 16 cores each.  Cluster 0 includes cores with
        coordinates from (0, 0) to (3, 3).  Cluster 1 includes cores with
        coordinates from (0, 4) to (3, 7).  

     2. We use z-parallelism only, so ultimately each core's output needs
        to be sent to every other core in both clusters. 

     2. Cluster 0 master is at (3, 3).  Cluster 1 master is at (0, 4). 

     3. In each cluster, all cores (including master) send their output
        activations to the local cluster's master (the gather operation).  

     4. The master multicasts the gathered activations to its own cluster (incl.
        to itself, with data looping back through NOC).  It also needs to send
        the same gathered data to the other master, and to multicast the data
        received from the other master to its local cluster.  (This can't be 
        done simply by including the other master into the same multicast that
        delivers data to the local cluster, since the multicast set would be
        non-rectangular.)

  Suppose also that NOC0 is directed so that the shortest path is between nodes
  (x, y)->(x+1, y) or (x, y)->(x, y+1), while NOC1 has the opposite direction.

  We can use the following overlay configuration:
  
      * Cluster 0 cores use NOC0 unicast to gather data at Master 0.
      * Cluster 1 cores use NOC1 unicast to gather data at Master 1.
      * Master 0 uses NOC1 multicast for output to Cluster 0.
      * Master 1 uses NOC0 multicast for output to Cluster 1.
      * Cluster 0 core (0, 3) uses NOC0 unicast to forward data received
        from Master 0 to Master 1 at (0, 4).
      * Cluster 1 core (3, 4) uses NOC1 unicast to forward data received
        from Master 0 to Master 1 at (3, 3).

  For the N->1 gather from each core to master, the master needs N input streams,
  which are then interleaved into a single output stream.  We need N separate 
  stream IDs for these, since each is associated with a separate buffer and a
  separate flow-control mechanism.  Another stream at master node is then used
  to interleave them and output them as multicast. 

  In the example, we use stream IDs:
    0      = local math/packer output (at each core)
    1      = local unpacker/math input for the next layer (at each core)
             (this is also forwarded to the other cluster's master from cores (0, 3) and (3, 4))
    2...17 = master gather inputs (from each core)
    18     = master multicast output 
    19     = master unicast input forwarded from the other cluster

  The initialization API calls would go as follows (shown for Cluster 0, similar for Cluster 1).

  All non-master cluster 0 cores:

      // Stream 0 = local math/packer output, sent to master
      noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(0, packer_output_buf, packer_output_buf_size, true);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_source_local_producer(0);
      my_index = my_y*4 + my_x; 
      my_dest_buf_at_master = master_gather_buf_start + my_index*master_buf_size_per_gather_source;
      noc_overlay_stream_set_dest_remote(0, NOC_XY_ADDR(3, 3, my_dest_buf_at_master0), master_buf_size_per_gather_source, false, 2+my_index);

      // Stream 1 = local math/unpacker input, received from master
      noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(1, unpacker_input_buf, unpacker_input_buf_size, true);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_source_remote(1, 3, 3, 18, my_index);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_dest_local_consumer(1);
      
  Core (0, 3) only:

      // this adds an extra destination (Master 1) to stream 1, giving it a fanout of 2:
      noc_overlay_stream_set_dest_remote(1, NOC_XY_ADDR(0, 4, dest_buf_at_master1), master1_cluster0_data_buf_size, false, 19);
 
  Master 0:

      // Stream 18 (master multicast output) is the destination for all input streams, including the local stream 0
      for each (gather_src_x, gather_src_y)
         src_index = gather_src_y*4 + gather_src_x; 
         stream_id = 2 + src_index
         noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(stream_id, master_gather_buf_start + src_index*master_buf_size_per_gather_source, gather_input_buf_size, true);
         noc_overlay_stream_set_source_remote(stream_id, gather_src_x, gather_src_y);
         noc_overlay_connect_local_streams(stream_id, 18);

      // Local math/packer output at Master 0 - also connect as one of stream 18 inputs:
      noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(0, packer_output_buf, packer_output_buf_size, true);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_source_local_producer(0);
      noc_overlay_connect_local_streams(0, 18);

      // Remote data from Master 1 via (3, 4)- also connect as one of stream 18 inputs:
      noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(19, master0_cluster1_data_buf, master0_cluster1_data_buf_size, true);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_source_remote(19, 3, 4, 1, 1);
      noc_overlay_connect_local_streams(19, 18);

      // Set multicast destination for stream 18
      noc_overlay_stream_set_dest_remote(18, NOC_MULTICAST_ADDR(0, 0, 3, 3), unpacker_input_buf_size, true, 1);

      // Stream 1 = local math/unpacker input, works the same as on non-master cores (data loops back through NOC router)
      noc_overlay_stream_set_buf(1, unpacker_input_buf, unpacker_input_buf_size, true);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_source_remote(1, 3, 3, 18, 3*4+3);
      noc_overlay_stream_set_dest_local_consumer(1);


  After initialization, everyone calls noc_overlay_stream_start(S) for each initialized stream S. 
  This will wait for "init complete" message from all downstream destinations (if any), and then send
  one upstream to all sources (if any). 


  During layer execution, the only code that needs to be executed by software is the handling of 
  packer data sources and unpacker data destinations (i.e., those streams initialized with the
  set_source_local_producer and set_dest_local_consumer calls).  Everything else runs automatically.
  
  Local producers/consumers need to use the polling functions below to establish buffer free space/
  data availability and then call data send/receive functions. 

 
  Once the layer is finished, everyone calls noc_overlay_stream_dealloc(S) for each initialized
  stream S.  This will wait for "dealloc" message from all upstream sources (if any), and then 
  flush all data from the local buffer and send a "dealloc" message to all downstream destinations
  (if any).  The function is non-blocking, so a polling function is available to test if deallocation
  of each stream's resources is complete.

//////////////////////////
// (2) Data send functions 

/*
  There are two mechanisms for data sending: 

    (1) For a stream with a dedicated buffer, we can use the following sequence:

        - Call noc_overlay_stream_buf_free_space to find out how much buffer space
          is currently free for sending data.  (Poll if not enough.)

        - Call noc_overlay_stream_buf_curr_write_ptr to get the write pointer where
          data should be written.  Write data to this localtion. 

        - Call noc_overlay_stream_send_data to send data down the stream.


    (2) Sender can also provide its own buffer with data to be sent:

        - Call noc_overlay_stream_send_data_buf to initiate sending data from a given
          address. 

        - Poll on noc_overlay_stream_data_buf_send_done to ensure data have been sent
          before the sender can discard/overwrite the buffer. 
          
        It is not possible to overlap multiple noc_overlay_stream_send_data_buf operations.
        I.e., each time noc_overlay_stream_send_data_buf is called, the caller must wait
        for the entire buffer to be sent before the memory space can be reused.
