- Formats 1-5 are floating point formats
- Formats 6-7 are integer formats
- Formats 9-14 are floating point formats with a shared exponent â€“ called Block Floating Point (BFP) formats

## Block Floating Point


### BFP Breakdown

Block Floating Point (BFP) support different element sizes by varying the # bits used for the mantissa, BFP8/4/2 support 8b/4b/2b elements respectively. 

The exponent is always shared across all elements in a block of 16 elements. Shared exponent supports A (5b padded to 8b) and B (8b) formats. The reason for an A format is to support compatibility with other 5b exponent formats such as Float16.


### BFP Data Conversion

When converting from Float to BFP. The shared exponent is calculated as follows:
1. Organize the data into 16-element blocks
2. Locate the next block to be converted
3. Find the maximum exponent across all elements in the block, append it to the shared exponent section
4. Left append 1 to each element's mantissa to make the implied 1 explicit
5. Calculate the exponent delta between the maximum exponent and the exponent of each element in the block
6. Right shift the mantissa by the exponent delta
7. Truncate bits to fit in the BFP format mantissa size, optionally round before truncation
8. Append the converted BFP block of elments to the data section
9. Repeat from step 2 until all blocks are converted


### Block Storage Efficiency

Exponent section overhead remains the same across BFP8, BFP4, BFP2. Data section size reduces by 2x for every 2x reduction in element size (BFP8->BFP4->BFP2).
