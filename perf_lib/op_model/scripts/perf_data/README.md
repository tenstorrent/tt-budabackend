This folder contains results of perf sweep runs for ops used to obtain parameters currently stored in `perf_lib/op_model/params/<arch_name>_params.yaml`.
The parameters are generated by `perf_lib/op_model/scripts/performance_model.py` script.

Note that the column names in some files might not be matching the column names of the perf sweep results - before we performed some data manipulation on the results before calling performance model; now performance model script handles all the manipulation, so that is not needed anymore.
