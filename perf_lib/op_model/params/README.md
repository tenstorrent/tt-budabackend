## Op model estimate params

Operation parameters in this directory are used to calculate estimated runtime of the ops with specific attributes and dimensions. FE uses this information to perform balancing. Estimated runtime for each op is calculated using a formula with known weights - params from this directory, and variables that represent op dimensions and attributes (number of tiles, ublocks, m_k, u_kt...). To obtain the params, we perform a linear regression on the data generated by perf sweep - op attributes, dimensions and its runtime. More information about how we obtain the params can be found in [perf_lib/op_model/scripts/README.md](../scripts/README.md).

For some ops, we obtain parameters using a single linear regression run on all data, for others, we segment the ops on a specific attribute (eg data format), and perform a regression for different values (eg Bfp vs FP16). Depending on the segmentation, we can have multiple sets of parameters for each op.

### WORMHOLE_B0


The following table shows status of the op model estimation params for B0. 

For each op we add params for, we should add unit tests that calculate estimated runtime for the data used to run the model and compare it with the real execution time. This is useful as it will raise a flag in case we switch params and start getting bigger estimation errors. 

The estimate / reality column shows the interval of the obtained ratio between estimate/reality.

*Matmul sparse has V1 and V2 formulas. Currently V1 formula is used for both GS and B0, although it has proven to be even 11x off in some cases. V2 formula is an updated version written for B0, and its range goes from 0.3 - 3.5x.


##
Params for the following ops should be regenerated - they either don't exist (default params fallback), have been calculated from the model using very old data, or manually added (without running a model on the perf data).


| Op                | Note                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| depthwise         | no perf sweep template; manually added params
| reduce-r          | current params don't perform well
| reduce-c          | current params don't perform well
| reduce-z          | current params don't perform well
| splice            | perf sweep template added recently; params should be recalculated
| embedding         | no params
| ethernet_datacopy | no params
| tilizer           | no params
| quantization      | no params
| dequantization    | no params
| requantization    | no params
| fused op          | no params; currently, FE doesn't call BBE API for fused op estimation, but has its own approximation

GENERAL NOTE: No estimation parameters were calculated for ops supporting INT8 and INT32 types. They should be added as well.
